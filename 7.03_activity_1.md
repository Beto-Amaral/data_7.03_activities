# 7.03 Activity 1

The datasets are provided in the `files_for_activities` folder.

1. Let's start with implementing another algorithm for feature selection, which is the **[Select K Best](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest.html)**. We have provided a code to you that you can use directly. Your task is to complete the parts missing in the code.
2. Let's work on the case where the target is categorical and the features are numerical. You can use the _chi square_ method and select top `k` features.
3. As you might notice here, one of the disadvantages of using `select_k_best` is that we have to provide the value of `k` ourself, through an estimated guess. We will see how the algorithm uses the _chi square_ score to select the top `k` features. There is a huge imbalance in the dataset as one category is very under-represented. For now, check the application on the data (as it is), and later we will talk about methods to remove the imbalance.

Complete the code below:

```python
X = numerical
y = targets['TARGET_B']

from sklearn.feature_selection import #######
from ############ import chi2
kbest = SelectKBest(chi2, k=10).fit_transform(#, #)
# Here we chose 10 so that is easier to analyze results later, as we will see
selected = pd.DataFrame(#####)
selected.head()

# To check the scores
model = SelectKBest(####, k=10).fit(#, #)
df =pd.########(data = model.scores_, columns = ['score'])
df['Column'] = numerical.columns
# Sorting data
print(df.#########(by = ['score'], ascending = False).head(10))
```

- Now we have sorted the dataframe in an decreasing order of the scores. The algorithm selects the columns with the largest scores (in this case top 10 scores). You can verify that by comparing the original data and the data returned by `select_k_best` as now we have the column names for the dataframe that was returned by the algorithm.

```python
# Just to check the columns, we can use the following code
cols = df.sort_values(by = ######, ascending = ######).head(10)['Column']
print(cols)
```
